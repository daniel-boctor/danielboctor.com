    It is not uncommon to see discrepancies in data between different sites. Our methodology is as follows.
    All monthly samples use month start data is used as an anchor point. This means that if a sample is displayed as March - October, the data spans March 1st - October 1st.
    In addition to this, daily data is used over the entire sample, from the first available close, right up until the most recent trading day, and will use the current intra-day price during market hours. 
    It is also imporant to note that if multiple securities have different inception dates, the most recent one will be used for the entire sample.

    <p><a class="link-dark faq" id="2" href="#2"><h5>What's next?</a></h5></p>
    Style analysis, dynamic weighting schemes, stochastic models, portfolio insurance, and machine learning models are all in the works.
